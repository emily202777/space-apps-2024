                <li>Hey ðŸ‘‹ ready to start tracking some exoplanets?

                    Letâ€™s get started, to begin tracking your exoplanets, youâ€™ll need: a computer or other device (school-issued), and a personal email account. 
                    
                    The process begins from small telescopes in the ground, that have been collecting data on the amount of light a distant star has been emitting over a period of time. This data can be retrieved from NASAâ€™s exoplanet watch website (join mailing list and receive the data to start tracking your first exoplanet). Next, this data is entered into a program that generates a light curve (weâ€™ll discuss how these work later), 
                    
                    How do these light curves work? 
                    </li>
